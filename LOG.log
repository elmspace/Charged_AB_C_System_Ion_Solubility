The code at the moment compiles. I have written a few Mod files to do calculations for different combination of parameters.
They compile, but I need to make sure that in the long run they produce the correct the results.
I will be doing some testing now.

Still have not solved the problem. I am comparing the MOD_main_Vcritical_vs_PA results with the previous calculations and they do not match exactly.

Looking to find why they don’t match.
doing more tests.

Still getting weird results.
I think the problem is with the Box minimization algorithm.
The problem is that the free energy depends on where we start from, V=0 or some V=v, this should not be the case.
I will be looking into that, and be doing some testing with that.

I fixed the main problem.
The problem was that if PA is changing, since pIave depends on PA, then pIave should also be updated.
The problem with the start position is still there, although it is minor now.
Will look into fixing the problem completely.
Also, I will write a function for finding the intersection between the deltafE and the f(x)=0 to find an accurate V_critical.
I have written the function, testing it now.
It works perfectly.  :)

Will be commiting all the changes so far and pushing it to GitHub.
I will pull it to SHARCNET and will run some jobs over night.

Today we will be looking at the MOD_main_Vcritical_vs_mu mod. We will be running some tests to see if things work fine.

Did some test runs. The results looked fine. The charge density when plotted in the y-direction (perpendicular to electrodes) didnt look symmetrical for the V=0.
There is no reason why it shouldnt be symmetrical, so will be looking into that.

Will be attempting to fix and test the MOD_main_Vcritical_vs_mu.
A side project: Try to allocate all the memory in the main.cpp and not in functions for speed up. This probably require branching.
Here is a list of all the places outside main.cpp where we are allocating memory:

- FreeEnergy.hh
- ConcAB.hh
- ConcI.hh
- fEhomo.hh
- size_adjust_1D_x.hh
- size_adjust_2D_xy.hh
- Slope_Calc2.hh
- Slope_Calc.hh
- solvediffeq.hh
- SolvePsi.hh
- WaveVectors.hh

For all these functions, we probably have make all these pointers global.

The MOD_main_Vcritical_vs_mu.hh is working and the results look good. Next step is to submit it to SHARCNET.

I have not looked into the optimization plan mentioned in log (Feb 17 2015 8:14 PM).
I have added some data files for the MOD_main_Vcritical_vs_PA/B_Sub for different xBI values, and the results look good.
Now we will be looking at the effect of PA on the lamellar spacing.
Did some test runs and there are some weird effects at large ion concentrations.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Today I will do some runs for low ion concentration and calculate the lamellar spacing.
Will do some test on the Vc-mu phase diagram and submit some jobs to SHARCNET.
I did most of the mu_Vc phase diagram for PA=0 case. 
The Lam_Spacing works fine is V_1=V_2=0.0, we dont have to remove the
boundaries. Although the Lamellar spacing still looks odd.

I have added a Mod that calculates the free energy of a single phase as a function of voltage.
Did some more calculations on the mu-vc phase diagram.
Will need to make a mod, that just calculates the free energy of different phases as a function of Vc, for a given mu, to get the mixed phase.
